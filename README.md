## Credits

Nostalgia Linux Operating System (NostixOS), the bespoke firmware tailored for the MagicX XU10 handheld gaming device, owes its existence to the relentless efforts of its primary developer and the collaborative contributions of dedicated individuals committed to elevating the user experience on the MagicX XU10.

Gratitude is extended to the following project and its contributors:

- JELOS System: Serving as the foundational framework, JELOS System provides the groundwork for NostixOS, forked from [Just Enough Linux Operating System (JELOS)](https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS).

We extend our heartfelt thanks to the vibrant open-source community, which serves as a continuous source of inspiration and innovation for projects like NostixOS.
